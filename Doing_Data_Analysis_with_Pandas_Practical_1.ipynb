    "# Data Analysis with Python Pandas\n",
    "In this notebook you will be going through the basics of interrogating and analysing data in Python with the Pandas package.  __[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)__, using data structures known as Dataframes which arrange data in a form similar to an excel spreadsheet, is a very powerful tool for quickly and effectively working with tabular data.  In this practical we will be investigating the [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data) dataset available on the Kaggle website.  We will learn to: load a .csv file into a dataframe; explore the data held in the dataframe; convert time information from string form into more useful time objects; subset a dataframe; reduce a dataframe through the groupby method; fit a simple model using the numpy package; and finally do some visualisation.  This might seem like a lot of things to do, but Pandas makes most of it quite straightforward!    "
